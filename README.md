### Compiling the code and running the tests ###

Maven (3) is used to compile the code and run the tests: 

* You can run maven manually using `mvn clean install` from the command line.
* You can run the cleanInstall.sh script, e.g.: 
    * `> chmod +x cleanInstall.sh`
    * `> ./cleanInstall.sh` 
* Run the project's only pom.xml file using your favourite IDE! (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Netbeans, etc.)
